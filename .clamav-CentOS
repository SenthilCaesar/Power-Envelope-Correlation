First, you need to assume root privilege 

sudo bash   (enter password)

or login on console as root if you have the password.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To begin with, on a CentOS 7 system, install ClamAV using 'yum'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[root@math ~]# yum -y install clamav

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Next, you need to run the 'freshclam' command to update/install the virus
databases.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[root@math ~]# freshclam

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For testing purposes, I downloaded a file with a text string in it which
is meant to trigger any AV program that is working properly.

https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950

And the specific download on the page is linked.
I downloaded this file to the /root directory as follows:

wget http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt

which retrieves and drops this file into the /root directory.

Now I can point clamscan at the /root folder and see what it finds.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

So it found it, but also issued a complaint about scanning a file that
was relatively large, which I can see as follows:

So the 99 Megabyte 'rpm' file is tripping up the scanner, so I can
up the size file it will scan:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

And let's not forget, that it did find the virus string in 
'eichar.com.txt' file which it flags as 'FOUND'.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now, there is a quarantine feature which we can enable.
If I designate /tmp/Q as a quarantine directory, then can
be used as quarantine containers are used in any other AV
software.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[root@math ~]# mkdir /tmp/Q
[root@math ~]# clamscan --max-filesize=100M -r --move=/tmp/Q /root

4 -rw-------   1 root root   68 May 20 20:32 eicar.com.txt

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Also, I can simply (and most importantly) have ClamAV remove the
offending item:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[root@math ~]# clamscan -r --remove /tmp/Q
/tmp/Q/eicar.com.txt: Win.Test.EICAR_HDB-1 FOUND

-------------------------------------
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Note, also that we can have ClamAV only show (and quartine)
only infected files, to avoid a lot of on-screen clutter.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[root@math ~]# cp ~tkohl/eicar.com.txt /root/
